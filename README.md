## 🐤 What Is Flappy Bird?

**Flappy Bird** is a simple yet addictive 2D game that took the internet by storm back in 2013. Created by Vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen, the game features a small bird you must guide through endless pipes by tapping or clicking to flap its wings. Sounds easy, right? But as anyone who has tried it knows, mastering Flappy Bird is a real challenge.

What made Flappy Bird special was its simplicity, pixel-style retro graphics, and the unforgiving "one mistake and it’s game over" rule. It became so popular that it ranked #1 on the App Store and Google Play Store – until it was removed by the creator in early 2014 due to its overwhelming popularity.
